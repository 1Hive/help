	 The Home page is a simple landing page that shows you the name of the organization you have loaded, as well as different actions that you can take using the pre-installed apps in your organization. For example, in the organization 
	<code>camino.aragonid.eth</code> we can perform the actions Assign Tokens, Vote, Check Finance, and New Payment.

<h4 id="menu"><a href="#menu">3.1.1 Menu features</a></h4>
<p>
	 In the menu on the top and left side of the screen, there are several features that you may find useful. Note that many of these features take advantage of the "local storage" in your browser, so if you clear your browser data then you may lose this data unless you make a backup.
</p>
<h4>3.1.1.1&nbsp;Network connection indicator</h4>
<p>
	 The network connection indicator will tell you if the Aragon client you are using is connected to one of the supported networks or not (either Ethereum or Rinkeby). If the node your Aragon client is connected to is having any issues then the light will turn red and indicate that the connection has failed. If the node your Aragon client is connected to is working properly, then the light will turn green and indicate that the client is successfully connected to the network.
</p>
<h4>3.1.1.2 Enable account</h4>
<p>
	 To use the Aragon client, you must first allow Aragon to access your Ethereum account. This will allow the Aragon client to send transactions to your Ethereum account for signing and to read information about your Ethereum account, such as the address and token balances. Click "Enable account" and approve the access request in your Ethereum provider to complete the process.
</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>3.1.1.3 Favorite organizations</h4>
<p>
	 You can click on the organization name at the top of the screen and click the "star" icon next to it to add the organization to your favorites. Then even if you go to another organization, you can click on the organization name and see your list of favorites that you can easily navigate to.

</p>
<h4>3.1.1.4 Activity status</h4>
<p>
	 Click the "alarm bell" icon to see the status of any transactions you have made using Aragon. You can clear the status history by clicking the "Clear history" button once you have made a transaction.

<h4>3.1.1.5 Global preferences</h4>
<p>
	 Click the "gear" icon to manage your global preferences. These preferences will be saved locally and used across every Aragon organization you use.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Custom labels<br>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Click on any Ethereum address throughout the Aragon client to give it a custom label, such as the name of the person or organization that owns the address. These labels will then show up in your global preferences under the Custom Labels tab. You can import a list of labels provided by someone else, and also export or any labels you have created. Make sure to export your labels from time to time to ensure you have a backup in case the local storage in your browser where the labels are stored is accidentally or intentionally cleared.
</p>
<p>

	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The Network tab of your global settings shows what Ethereum and IPFS nodes you are currently connected to. You can modify these settings to use any Ethereum or IPFS node you want, including nodes running locally on your own computer. Using Aragon with your own nodes has privacy and security benefits, and possibly performance benefits as well.
</p>
<p>
	If you are having any issues using Aragon, a common troubleshooting method is to clear your application cache. There's a button in the Network tab that makes this easy to do. Make sure to export a backup of your custom labels before you clear your application cache, or else you will lose all of your custom labels.

	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	You can opt-in to email notifications about activity in organizations that you are interested in on the Notifications tab of your global preferences.

	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The "Help and feedback" tab of your global preferences gives you the option to enable or disable the Help Scout module that shows up as a question mark inside a circle in the bottom-right corner throughout the client.
</p>
<p>
	If you need help at any time, you can click the HelpScout module, opt-in to connecting to HelpScout and loading the module, then search for user documentation or create a support ticket right inside the Aragon client. If you prefer not to load the HelpScout module, you can find the documentation or create a support ticket at 
	<a href="https://help.aragon.org" target="_blank">help.aragon.org</a>.
