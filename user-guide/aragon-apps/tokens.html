	 The Tokens app is used to manage membership and voting power in an organization. To add members to an organization, it’s as easy as minting and assigning a token to them.
</p>
<p>
	 With the Company template, one token equals one vote, members can hold as many tokens as are assigned to them, and tokens are transferable. With the Membership template, one token also equals one vote but members cannot hold more than one token each and tokens are non-transferable. And with the Reputation template, one token equals one vote, and members can hold as many tokens as are assigned to them, but the tokens are non-transferable.
</p>
<p>
	 This simple process for managing membership and voting power provides the foundation for governing the resources of an organization using Aragon.

	 In the Holder section of the Tokens app you can see the current list of tokenholders and the balance of organization tokens they each hold. Clicking on the dropdown menu on one of the rows in the list will provide you options for assigning more tokens to that tokenholder or removing tokens from the tokenholder.

</p>
<ul>
	<li>Token supply: how many tokens have been minted in total</li>
	<li>Transferable: whether or not the token can be transferred to another entity after it has been assigned</li>
	<li>Token: the token name and token symbol</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ownership"><a href="#ownership">3.2.3 Ownership Distribution</a></h4>
