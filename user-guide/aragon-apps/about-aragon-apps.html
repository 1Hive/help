<p>
	 As mentioned in the earlier section 
	<a href="https://aragon.helpscoutdocs.com/article/6-anatomy-of-an-aragon-organization" target="_blank">Anatomy of an Aragon organization</a>, Aragon organizations have the ability to extend their functionality using Aragon apps. The apps that come pre-installed with Company, Membership, and Reputation organizations are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tokens</li>
	<li>Voting</li>
	<li>Finance</li>
	<li>Agent (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 There is also a Home page and the Permissions, App Center, and Organization "System apps" that every Aragon organization comes with by default. In this section we will explore each of these in detail.
