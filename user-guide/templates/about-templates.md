<p>
	 Templates are pre-configured smart contracts for different types of organizations. You can use the templates that are included with Aragon or 
	<a href="https://github.com/aragon/dao-templates" target="_blank">create your own</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	 Aragon currently includes three templates:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/30-create-a-new-company-organization" target="_blank">Company</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/34-create-a-new-membership-organization" target="_blank">Membership</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/32-create-a-new-reputation-organization" target="_blank">Reputation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	 This section will walk you through examples of how you can use these templates as a starting point for your organization.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Note: If the default templates don't give you exactly what you want for your organization, you can set up a <a href="https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started#environment-setup" target="_blank">development environment</a> and use the <a href="https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro" target="_blank">aragonCLI</a> to <a href="https://hack.aragon.org/docs/guides-custom-deploy" target="_blank">create a custom organization</a>.</em>
