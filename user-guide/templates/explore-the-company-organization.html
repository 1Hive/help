	 The Home page welcomes you to your organization and offers you several options for different actions you can take. You can also use the menu on the left-hand side of the screen to view the different apps that are currently installed for your organization. This organization currently has the Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Agent apps installed, plus default Permissions, App Center, and Organization "System" apps.

<h4 id="tokens"><a href="#tokens">2.2.2 Tokens app<br>
</a></h4>
<p>
	 Use the Tokens app to mint new tokens and assign them to yourself or other entities. Tokens minted by the Tokens app confer voting abilities to holders of the tokens such that one token equals one vote. Tokens in a Company organization are transferable, and there is no inherent limit to the number of tokens that can be minted and held by any tokenholder.
</p>
<p>
	 There are many reasons an organization might mint tokens for entities. Here are a few examples:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The organization commits to giving its workers a stake in the company e.g. half of the company tokens are held by workers and the other half by investors </li>
	<li>The organization mints tokens to entities proportional to the amount of funds they have invested in the company</li>
	<li>The organization mints a specific amount of tokens for an entity in exchange for a specific good or service </li>
	<li>The organization mints a fixed amount of tokens per month and distributes them proportionally to everyone who has contributed value to the organization that month</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
	 You can mint new tokens by following these steps:
</p>
<h4>2.2.2.1 Click “Add Tokens” button</h4>
<p>
	 Enter the address of the recipient of the tokens and the number of new tokens you want to mint and assign to that address, then click “Add Tokens”.
</p>

</p>
<h4>2.2.2.2 Create vote to assign tokens</h4>
<p>
	 Even though you are the only tokenholder at this point, the Company organization still requires a tokenholder vote for every action. Click “Create transaction” to create the transaction that creates a new vote to assign the new token you want to mint. Sign the transaction in your Ethereum provider, wait for a confirmation, then move on to the next step.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h4>2.2.2.3 Vote "Yes" to approve the “Assign Tokens” vote</h4>
<p>
	 Go to the Voting app, click on the "Mint tokens" proposal you just created, and vote "Yes" to approve minting and assigning the token.

<h4>2.2.2.4 Check out the newest member of your organization</h4>

	 Your organization just went from one to two members. A good start to a new Company organization!
</p>
<p>
	<em>Note: If a vote is cast that causes the Minimum Approval % to be equal to or greater than the Support required (e.g. 60% Support with 60% Minimum Approval) then the vote will execute automatically. If the Minimum Approval % is less than the Support required (e.g. 60% Support with 40% Minimum Approval) then additional "no" votes could still stop the vote from being passed, so the vote will remain open until either the duration is reached or the Minimum Approval % is equal to or greater than the Support requirement. After the vote ends, the result must be enacted manually by one of the tokenholders in the organization.<br>

</a></h4>
<p>
	 The Voting app makes it easy for you to poll your fellow tokenholders about their position on an infinite range of topics. Votes initiated by other Aragon apps also show up in the Voting app. For example, assigning tokens using the Token Manager or moving funds from the Finance app are each actions that require a vote by tokenholders in a Company organization. Follow these steps to create a new vote and poll your organization about a topic you care about:

</p>
<h4>2.2.3.3 Vote on the proposal, then ask the other tokenholders to review and vote on the proposal</h4>
<p>
	 Vote on the proposal you just created. Then rally your fellow tokenholders outside the app - for example, by email, forum, chat room, or good old fashioned face-to-face - and ask them to review and vote on the proposal too. Tokenholders can visit the Voting app to see the list of open votes and cast their ballot accordingly.
</p>

</p>
<h4>2.2.3.4 Other tokenholders cast their vote</h4>
<p>
	 In this case, the other tokenholder in the organization supports the proposal and votes "Yes".

<h4>2.2.3.5 Review the vote</h4>
<p>
	 Since there are only two tokenholders in this organization, and the Support parameter is set to 50%, the unanimous vote on the proposal has resulted in the proposal being passed.
